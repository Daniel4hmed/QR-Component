## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Making use of the `<main>` tag.
- Avoid using fixed units (`px`) and focus on `rem` units unless specified.

### Continued development

- I personally need to continue learning / making use of flexbox as I did get a little stuck on centering the component vertically.
